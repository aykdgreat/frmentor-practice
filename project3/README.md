## My process

### Built with
- Vanilla CSS (though I used bootstrap at first)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### My Experience

I started today's development on a brother's laptop which he offered me when I visited him but ended up doing the css from scratch because visitation time elapsed and I had to go home. I copied the work to my phone to contiue but discovered what I thought was mobile view on PC (browser width though, not dev tools) is actually wider than my machine's width (my phone I mean).

I had started with the html before going to visit him but when he asked if I'll be using bootstrap, I said yes (to challenge myself) then started. Worked with him by my side for about 4hrs but since I didn't continue, the duration/completion time I recorded for this project is the total time I spent building it on my phone.

I had to still work on it the next day (though still mobile view only) so day 4 project is going to be shifted.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0) - I spent a lot of tkme here being my first time using bootstrap for a big design, thanks to my brother who suggested that.
